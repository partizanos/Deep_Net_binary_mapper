# Deep Net Binary Mapper

Dataset consists of ”original” and modified "data".
Each original correspons to a modified one 

This code implements a Deep Net binary mapper in Python that maps the modified codes into the originals.

The results are evaluted based on the regeneration accuracy of the mapper with respect to the original codes.
